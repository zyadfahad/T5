Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, deep learning algorithms are designed to learn complex patterns in data by using multiple layers of interconnected nodes or neurons. This ability to learn hierarchical representations of data has made deep learning a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various domains.\n",

            "Deep learning has its roots in the 1940s and 1950s, when the first artificial neural networks were developed. However, it wasn't until the 1970s and 1980s that the first deep learning algorithms were proposed. The development of backpropagation in the 1980s enabled the efficient training of deep neural networks. The modern era of deep learning began in the 2000s, with the introduction of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.\n",

            "* **Backpropagation**: An optimization algorithm used to train deep neural networks by minimizing the error between the network's predictions and the actual outputs.\n",
